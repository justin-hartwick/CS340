# CS340
This project represents my final work for CS-340, where I developed a functional web dashboard that connects a MongoDB database to a Dash interface in Python. The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard was designed to help the client explore animal shelter data and identify dogs that could be trained for different types of rescue work. The application combines several elements, including a dynamic data table, a bar chart visualization, and an interactive map. Together, these features make it easier for the client to understand large amounts of data and use it in practical decision-making. I created the interface using Python, Dash, Plotly Express, and Dash Leaflet, while MongoDB handled all database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

During development, I encountered a few technical challenges that helped me grow as a programmer. When JupyterDash became unreliable, I switched to Dash for better performance. A missing preview link required adjusting the hostname within the Codio environment, and a ValueError in the chart was resolved by updating column names to match Plotly’s requirements. These experiences reinforced the importance of testing small sections of code and keeping good documentation. The project followed a Model–View–Controller structure, where the MongoDB database served as the model, the Dash interface acted as the view, and the callbacks linked user input to database queries as the controller. This structure made it easier to organize the code and allowed for future improvements, such as adding login authentication or more advanced filters.

When writing the code, I focused on making it readable and adaptable. I used descriptive variable names, clear comments, and modular functions so each part of the program was easy to understand. Separating the database logic in the animal_shelter.py file from the dashboard interface made the project easier to maintain and reuse. This same CRUD module can be used in future applications that rely on MongoDB without needing major edits. This approach to organization and clarity helps ensure the project remains stable and flexible over time.

For this assignment, I approached the problem the way a computer scientist would. I began by analyzing what the client needed, then broke the project into small, manageable parts. I first confirmed the database connection, tested each CRUD operation, and then built the user interface before connecting the two components. This methodical approach prevented confusion and allowed me to identify errors early. Compared with earlier courses, this project required a stronger focus on usability and client needs, which helped me think more about the human side of software design. In the future, I plan to continue using this step-by-step process to build applications that are both functional and user-friendly.

Computer scientists create systems that turn raw information into useful tools. The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard demonstrates this purpose by transforming unorganized data into a meaningful and interactive experience. It allows the client to identify patterns, visualize information, and make faster and more accurate decisions. Through projects like this, computer scientists contribute to real-world solutions that improve efficiency and help organizations work more effectively. This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also showed how computing can make a positive difference when applied thoughtfully.
